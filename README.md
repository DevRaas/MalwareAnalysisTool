# Malware Analysis Tool

This project is a simple file analysis tool that computes the SHA-256 hash of a file and sends it to the VirusTotal API for malware detection. It is designed with a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to easily select a file and analyze its safety.

---

## Features

- **File Hashing:** Computes the SHA-256 hash of the selected file, which uniquely identifies it.
- **VirusTotal API Integration:** Sends the file's hash to VirusTotal for scanning. The result includes the number of engines that flagged the file as malicious.
- **User-Friendly GUI:** Built using Tkinter, allowing easy file selection and displaying the results directly in the window.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `hashlib`, `requests`, and `tkinter` libraries

Install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install requests hashlib tkinter
```


## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevRaas/MalwareAnalysisTool.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd MalwareAnalysisTool
   ```

3. **Replace the VirusTotal API Key:**

   Open the `main.py` file and replace the `API_KEY` variable with your VirusTotal API key:

   ```python
   API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Analyze a File:**

   - Click on the "Select File" button to choose a file for analysis.
   - The file's SHA-256 hash will be computed and sent to VirusTotal.
   - The result will show how many VirusTotal engines flagged the file as malicious.
